Project was made as a part of engineering thesis.

Application made in order to visualize time evolution of a knotted electromagnetic field which is a topologically non-trivial solution to Maxwell equations in a vacuum. The program works in two different modes. First one visualizes time evolution of a single field line as an animation. User can choose time when the simulation starts and watch how the field line change from that moment. The second mode enables the user to choose how many lines to draw and calculates them at the given time, so we can observe how the electric and magnetic field looks like in general. User can choose position of the camera in both variants by changing azimuth and elevation.
